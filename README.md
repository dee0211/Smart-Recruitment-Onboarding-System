The TalentBridge project was developed as a Salesforce-based recruitment and HR management portal. It streamlines the recruitment lifecycle from job creation to candidate application, interview scheduling, offer management, and onboarding. The solution leverages Salesforce declarative capabilities (configuration, automation) as well as programmatic development (Apex, LWC). Dashboards and KPIs enable HR and recruiters to track hiring performance in real-time.
